# CoffeeMachine

This is my very first project using the PyCharm editor.

It is a very simple project with some data stored in the data file. 
The user is prompted to insert their name and what kind of coffee they wish to have.

Afterwards, the user has to insert coins into the machine. The machine evaluates the
transaction and the user then receives feedback.

Exit the game with the prompt "off".

Languages used: Python

For running this project, just fork it using GitHub and run it with the following command when in the main directory.

```
python main.py
```

I am grateful if you leave comments and recommendations on how to improve behind.
